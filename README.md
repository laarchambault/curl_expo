The CurlExpo is designed to help users with naturally curly hair find products for their hair by hair-type. This site allows users to create a login with details about their hair type, and allows users to view/edit hair products with reviews, and to save products they like or want to try.

The most valuable feature of this web page is the ability to filter reviews by the hair type of the reviewer. Users can use this filter so see the average rating JUST for products that match their hair type.
